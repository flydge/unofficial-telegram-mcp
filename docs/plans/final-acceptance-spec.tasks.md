# Final acceptance — tasks

Spec: [`final-acceptance-spec.md`](final-acceptance-spec.md).

- [ ] Criterion 1: Full isolated-HOME suite green with 0 skipped (suite).
- [ ] Criterion 2: Every synthetic and agent matrix cell PASS with a bound receipt; a deliberate schema change fails it (harness).
- [ ] Criterion 3: TDLib procedure written; rehearsal reproduces d1085f9 natives and lock byte-identically (rehearsal record).
- [x] Criterion 4: F19 transport pins pass (unit tests) — `tests/test_transport_scope.py`, 823ccf7.
- [ ] Criterion 5: Audit table complete; critic finds no unresolved applicable gap (critic report).
- [ ] Open item for the criterion 5 audit (recorded 24.10.2026 from 0.55; not 0.55's): a first install never moves
      the default's own runtime.toml version line, so an uninstall and a reinstall at another version meets
      config_stale and then policy_conflict (0.53/0.54 behaviour; 0.55 left it unchanged under criterion 2).
- [ ] **Owner row** — deferred to the owner session (criterion 6): Owner session rows (clean user, dialogs, two accounts, Claude Desktop, migration) and Gpub.
